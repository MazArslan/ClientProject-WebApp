It also works in conjunction with the hippocampus to form conscious memories. <h3>The case of Henry Molaison 1926-2008: </h3> From an early age, Henry suffered from severe epilepsy. In an effort to control his seizures, he had an operation that removed a large part of his temporal lobe and hippocampus on both sides. Whilst the surgery cured him of his epilepsy, tragically he was left unable to form new memories.   ',
